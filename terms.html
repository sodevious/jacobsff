	<h5>PRIVACY POLICY</h5>

	<p class="post-content">Last Updated: January 14, 2020.</p>
	<p class="post-content">Welcome to the Jacobs Family Foundation Website (the “Site”), owned and operated by the Jacobs Family Foundation (“we,” “us,” or “our”).  The following privacy policy (this “Privacy Policy”) informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of all personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”), and any other data that is provided to us through use of the Site. By submitting Personal Information to us, you agree that we may use the Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
	<p class="post-content">We reserve the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time without prior notice, so please be sure to review this Privacy Policy from time to time. This Privacy Policy was last updated on the date indicated at the top of this page. Please review this Privacy Policy periodically for such changes, and especially before you provide any Personal Information.</p>
	<p class="post-content">Please note that this Privacy Policy governs only information provided to the Site and communications with us through the Site. It does not govern any other information or communications that may reference the Jacobs Family Foundation.</p>

	<h5>PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE COLLECT IT</h5>

	<p class="post-content">We do not collect Personal Information about you unless you choose to provide us with such information. Personal Information is information that identifies you as a particular individual, such as your name, mailing address, phone number, or e-mail address.</p>
	<p class="post-content">When you contact us via e-mail or through the contact form on the Site, we may collect Personal Information about you such as your name and e-mail address, as well as any other content or information you provide to us.</p>
	<p class="post-content">If you would prefer that we not collect any Personal Information from you, please do not provide us with such information. When you submit your Personal Information to us, you are giving your consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>

	<h5>HOW WE USE THE PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h5>

	<p class="post-content">The Personal Information you provide us may be used for the purposes of (i) communicating with you, (ii) record keeping, (iii) the establishment, pursuit, and/or defense of legal claims, and (iv) other lawful purposes.</p>
	<p class="post-content">The Personal Information you provide us may also be used to create and deliver to you emails such as our newsletters  or other email messages containing news,  information or announcements (“Emails”).  If you prefer not to receive such Emails, please do not register to receive these Emails.  If you do register and later decide that you would no longer like to receive these Emails, see the Review, Update or Delete Your Information Section below.</p>

	<h5>DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES</h5>

	<p class="post-content">We do not share your Personal Information with any third-parties unless: (1) we determine that an applicable law, regulation or legal process requires it, (2) in response to a court order or a request from law enforcement personnel or another governmental authority, or (3) if we determine that we need to share your Personal Information with others to protect or enforce our rights under the Terms and Conditions of the Site or protect other users of the Site.</p>
	<p class="post-content">If you do not wish to have your Personal Information shared in this way, please email us anytime at <a href="mailto:contact@jacobsff.org">contact@jacobsff.org</a>.</p>

	<h5>COLLECTION AND USE OF NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION, COOKIES, AND ONLINE TRACKING</h5>

	<p class="post-content">We may collect non-personal information, or data in a form that does not, on its own, permit direct association with any specific individual. For example, we may collect and store details of how you access and use our Site. This “usage data” is limited to information related to your interactions with the Site, including time spent on the Site and changes made while logged onto the Site.</p>
	<p class="post-content">We may use cookies and log your IP address to track your visits to the Site. A cookie is a message that is sent to your computer from a Web server and stored on your computer’s hard drive. An IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer automatically when you use the Internet.</p>
	<p class="post-content">We do not link our cookies or your IP address to any of your Personal Information. We may aggregate this data with that of other users on the Site and analyze it to improve the Site. We may share aggregated data with potential partners in connection with the promotion of the Site. However, this aggregated data does not include your Personal Information.</p>
	<p class="post-content">We use a tool called “Google Analytics” to collect information about use of this site. Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit this site, what pages they visit when they do so, and what other sites they used prior to coming to our Site. We use the information we get from Google Analytics only to improve our Site. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit our Site, rather than your name or other Personal Information. We do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with Personal Information. Although Google Analytics plants a permanent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit our Site, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to our Site is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use, available at [<a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites</a>] and the Google Privacy Policy, available at [<a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>]. You can prevent Google Analytics from recognizing you on return visits to our Site by disabling cookies on your browser.</p>
	<p class="post-content">We also use Facebook Analytics to record events and understand how users are utilizing our Site. Similarly to the operation of the Google Analytics services, Facebook receives information from our Site to provide measurement services and they reserve the right to utilize the information for ad targeting. Note that Facebook allows users to opt-out of which companies can utilize their information, by visiting the following website: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=privacy" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=privacy</a>.</p>
	<p class="post-content">We use Twitter’s Twitter Ads product, which is an analytics service that connects data from the Twitter advertising network with actions performed on our Site.  These products collect user data through our Site for purposes of conversion tracking and serving ads targeted to users’ interests through various means, including the storing and accessing of cookies.  Users can opt out of Twitter’s interest-based advertising through Twitter’s opt-out mechanism, available at: <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/safety-and-security/privacy-controls-for-tailored-ads" target="_blank"> https://help.twitter.com/en/safety-and-security/privacy-controls-for-tailored-ads</a>.</p>
	<p class="post-content">Again, you can choose to remove or disable cookies in your browser settings and you may use browser extensions with our Site that limit the ability of third parties to set certain types of cookies, including those from Google, Facebook, and Twitter.  Such actions may not be sufficient to disable all such third-party tracking devices and activities.</p>
	<p class="post-content">Please be aware that we do not currently honor “do not track” requests.</p>

	<h5>NO WARRANTIES OR GUARANTEES</h5>

	<p class="post-content">Although we take reasonable measures to help protect your Personal Information,  we do not guarantee or warrant that such measures will prevent unauthorized access to your Personal Information. Transmissions on the Internet cannot be made absolutely secure. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the security of our databases and we assume no responsibility or liability for disclosure of information you supply us due to errors in transmission, unauthorized third-party access, or other causes beyond our reasonable control.</p>

	<h5>CHILDREN</h5>

	<p class="post-content">We will not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under age 13.</p>

	<h5>THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES AND SERVICES</h5>

	<p class="post-content">The Site may contain links to third-party websites. We do not control the privacy policies of third parties that have websites linked to the Site. If you click on a link, the privacy policies of the website that you link to will govern the use of your information by that website’s operator. We assume no responsibility or liability for the actions of third parties with respect to their use of your information. Accordingly, we encourage you to learn about, and make sure you are comfortable with, the privacy policies of any third-party websites to which you link.</p>

	<h5>CROSS-BORDER TRANSFER</h5>

	<p class="post-content">The information you provide us may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where data protection laws may be different from those of your jurisdiction. By providing information on the Site, you hereby expressly consent to such a transfer for the purposes described herein.</p>
	<p class="post-content">For the purposes of the remainder of this section, references to “you” refer to users of the Site located within the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or other non-U.S. territories.</p>
	<p class="post-content">For users of the Site located within the EEA or other non-U.S. territories, please note that any information you provide on the Site will be transferred outside the EEA or such other non-U.S. territory for use by us as described herein. </p>
	<p class="post-content">The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and other applicable data protection laws provide certain rights for EEA residents. You are entitled to review the Personal Information we hold about you as well as details on how we process such Personal Information. You also have a right in accordance with the GDPR to have your Personal Information corrected or erased, to restrict our processing of that Personal Information, to stop unauthorized transfers of your Personal Information and, in some circumstances, to have your Personal Information transferred to another organization designated by you. You also have the right to lodge a complaint in relation to our processing of your Personal Information with your local supervisory authority. If you do not request to have your Personal Information erased, it may be maintained by us indefinitely.</p>
	<p class="post-content">If you object to the processing of your Personal Information, or if you have provided your consent to processing and you later choose to withdraw it, we will respect that choice in accordance with our legal obligations. Please note that even after you have chosen to withdraw your consent, we may continue to process your Personal Information to the extent required or otherwise permitted by law, in particular in connection with exercising and defending our legal rights or meeting our legal and regulatory obligations.</p>

	<h5>CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS</h5>
	<p class="post-content">It is our policy not to share your Personal Information with third parties unless you are first given the opportunity to opt-out of such sharing. You may opt-out of any disclosure of your Personal Information by contacting us at <a href="mailto:contact@jacobsff.org">contact@jacobsff.org</a>.</p>

	<p class="post-content">We do not currently respond to web browser “do not track” signals or other mechanisms that provide a method to opt-out of the collection of information across the networks of websites and online services in which we participate.  If we do so in the future, we will describe how we do so in this Privacy Policy.</p>

	<h5>REVIEW, CORRECT OR UPDATE PERSONAL INFORMATION</h5>

	<p class="post-content">If you would like to review, update, change, or delete information that we have collected, from you, or if you would like to opt-out of receiving emails, please contact us at <a href="mailto:contact@jacobsff.org">contact@jacobsff.org</a>. Please note that changes may not be effective immediately and will only be effective prospectively.</p>

	<p class="post-content">PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES AND CLAIMS WITH THE TRUST AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US.</p>
	<p class="post-content">All matters relating to the Site and these Terms and any dispute or claim arising therefrom or related thereto (in each case, including non-contractual disputes or claims), shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of California in the United States without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule. To the extent that any lawsuit or court proceeding is permitted hereunder, you and The Trust agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts and federal courts located within San Francisco County, California for the purpose of litigating all such disputes.</p>
	<p class="post-content">ANY DISPUTE, CLAIM OR CONTROVERSY RELATING IN ANY WAY TO YOUR USE OF THE SITE OR THESE TERMS WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION, RATHER THAN IN COURT. YOU AGREE THAT, BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS, THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT AND FEDERAL ARBITRATION LAW APPLY TO ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND THE TRUST AND THAT, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, YOU AND THE TRUST ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION SHALL SURVIVE TERMINATION OF THESE TERMS.</p>
	<p class="post-content">There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages).</p>
	<p class="post-content">If you elect to seek arbitration or file a small claims court action, you must first send to The Trust, by certified mail, a written notice of your claim (a “Notice”). The Notice must be addressed to: Justin Jacobs Jr. Charitable Trust, Attn: Cynthia R. Rowland, 235 Montgomery Street, San Francisco, CA 94104 (the&nbsp;“Notice Address”). A Notice, whether sent by you or The Trust, must (a) describe the nature and basis of the dispute, claim or controversy; and (b)&nbsp;set forth the specific relief sought including a detailed explanation of how the amount of any monetary relief was calculated (the “Demand”). If The Trust and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, you or The Trust may commence an arbitration proceeding or, if applicable, file a claim in small claims court.</p>
	<p class="post-content">The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, the “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (the&nbsp;“AAA”), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. In the event of a conflict or inconsistency between the AAA Rules and this arbitration provision, this arbitration provision shall govern. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision. The arbitrator must strictly construe and apply these Terms as written and must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.</p>
	<p class="post-content">YOU AND THE TRUST AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and The Trust agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims with your claims. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void (for removal of doubt, the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void only if this specific provision regarding the requirement that claims be brought only in your or The Trust’s individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding, is deemed unenforceable. If any other clause or provision of this arbitration provision is found to be unenforceable, then pursuant to Section 12 below, that specific clause or provision shall be struck, and the remainder of this arbitration provision shall be enforced). The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.</p>

	<li>Termination</li>

	<p class="post-content">Notwithstanding anything contained in these Terms, we reserve the right, without notice and in our sole discretion, to terminate your right to access or use the Site, at any time and for any or no reason, and you acknowledge and agree that we shall have no liability or obligation to you in such event, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.</p>

No waiver of any provision of these Terms will constitute a waiver of such provision in any prior, concurrent or subsequent circumstance, and our failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. Except as otherwise provided herein, these Terms are intended solely for the benefit of the parties and are not intended to confer third party beneficiary rights upon any other person or entity.</p>
